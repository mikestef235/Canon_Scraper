# Canon_Scraper
This is a repo for the Canon Craigslist Scraper personal project. The primary goal is to track listings of Canon cameras on Craigslist, monitoring for slight changes in description, price decreases, and how long it takes an item to sell. In addition, a word cloud in the shape of a canon camera is generated from listing descriptions.
