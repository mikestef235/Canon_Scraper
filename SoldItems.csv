The f/2.8 maximum aperture performs well in low-light situations, and provides a shallow depth of field for selective focus. Further benefitting the lens is the VC (Vibration Compensation) image stabilization, which helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake to enable the use of longer shutter speeds or smaller apertures when hand-holding in low-light conditions. XGM and LD glass elements reduce chromatic aberrations and help ensure sharp and clear imagery. eBAND and BBAR coatings render uniform colors and reduce ghosting and flare, while a fluorine coating on the front element helps repel water or contaminants.A USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) autofocus motor provides quick and precise focusing performance, with high torque, low response times, and quiet operation to benefit both still and video applications. Additionally, a full-time manual focus mechanism enables manual fine-tuning of focus at any point, even when the AF system is engaged.Image QualityComprised of 18 elements in 13 groups, including an XGM (eXpanded Glass Molded Aspherical) element placed at the front group and several LD (Low Dispersion) glass elements in the system, aberrations such as geometrical distortion and lateral color are efficiently compensated for, enabling the zoom lens to deliver quality imagery throughout the entire range from corner to corner.BBAR and eBAND CoatingsBBAR (Broad-Band Anti-Reflection) coating renders uniformity in transmissivity across the critical bandwidths. Coupled with the eBAND coating, ghosting and flare typically observed on ultra wide-angle lenses are efficiently eliminated, resulting in sharper and clearer images.VCVC (Vibration Compensation) is Tamron's proprietary image stabilization mechanism which reduces the effects of camera shake to deliver sharp images in low light and at slower shutter speeds. It is a newly developed three coil system that employs a lighter moving coil mechanism which contributes to its improved performance and overall compact design.Ultrasonic MotorUSD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) Motor is the power for a fast and quiet autofocus drive that works in harmony with the continuous manual focus mechanism.XGM and LD Glass ElementsAn eXpanded Glass Molded Aspherical element and Low Dispersion elements in the front group minimize chromatic aberrations and help ensure clear and sharp imagery.Lens HoodA built-in lens hood helps block out unwanted light, preventing lens flare, as well as protecting the lens's front element.DiaphragmA rounded 9-blade diaphragm produces an aesthetic out-of-focus quality that is especially beneficial when working with selective focus or shallow depth of field techniques.SILKYPIX Developer Studio for TamronThe SILKYPIX software provides allows you to generate quality images from RAW data, while performing adjustments to reflect your personal style. These include white balance, color, sharpness, and the tonal curves recorded by digital cameras. The SILKYPIX Developer Studio for Tamron provides a range of functions, in addition to the basic adjustment capabilities, such as correcting aberrations (lateral color, distortion, relative illumination fall-off) referring to the optical design data.Nikon canon Tamron sigma Fuji camera    ",960,0,Nikon Tamron 15-30mm 2.8 SP

The f/2.8 maximum aperture performs well in low-light situations, and provides a shallow depth of field for selective focus. Further benefitting the lens is the VC (Vibration Compensation) image stabilization, which helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake to enable the use of longer shutter speeds or smaller apertures when hand-holding in low-light conditions. XGM and LD glass elements reduce chromatic aberrations and help ensure sharp and clear imagery. eBAND and BBAR coatings render uniform colors and reduce ghosting and flare, while a fluorine coating on the front element helps repel water or contaminants.A USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) autofocus motor provides quick and precise focusing performance, with high torque, low response times, and quiet operation to benefit both still and video applications. Additionally, a full-time manual focus mechanism enables manual fine-tuning of focus at any point, even when the AF system is engaged.Image QualityComprised of 18 elements in 13 groups, including an XGM (eXpanded Glass Molded Aspherical) element placed at the front group and several LD (Low Dispersion) glass elements in the system, aberrations such as geometrical distortion and lateral color are efficiently compensated for, enabling the zoom lens to deliver quality imagery throughout the entire range from corner to corner.BBAR and eBAND CoatingsBBAR (Broad-Band Anti-Reflection) coating renders uniformity in transmissivity across the critical bandwidths. Coupled with the eBAND coating, ghosting and flare typically observed on ultra wide-angle lenses are efficiently eliminated, resulting in sharper and clearer images.VCVC (Vibration Compensation) is Tamron's proprietary image stabilization mechanism which reduces the effects of camera shake to deliver sharp images in low light and at slower shutter speeds. It is a newly developed three coil system that employs a lighter moving coil mechanism which contributes to its improved performance and overall compact design.Ultrasonic MotorUSD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) Motor is the power for a fast and quiet autofocus drive that works in harmony with the continuous manual focus mechanism.XGM and LD Glass ElementsAn eXpanded Glass Molded Aspherical element and Low Dispersion elements in the front group minimize chromatic aberrations and help ensure clear and sharp imagery.Lens HoodA built-in lens hood helps block out unwanted light, preventing lens flare, as well as protecting the lens's front element.DiaphragmA rounded 9-blade diaphragm produces an aesthetic out-of-focus quality that is especially beneficial when working with selective focus or shallow depth of field techniques.SILKYPIX Developer Studio for TamronThe SILKYPIX software provides allows you to generate quality images from RAW data, while performing adjustments to reflect your personal style. These include white balance, color, sharpness, and the tonal curves recorded by digital cameras.

I sold my camera and now I'm selling my lenses.Nikon canon Tamron sigma Fuji cameraAn ideal focal length for portraiture, the SP 85mm f/1.8 Di VC USD Lens from Tamron is a short-telephoto prime designed for FX-format Nikon F-mount DSLRs. Incorporating one Low Dispersion element and one Extra Low Dispersion element into the optical design, this lens is adept at reducing chromatic aberrations and color fringing for a high degree of clarity and color accuracy, as well as sharpness and resolution. BBAR and eBAND coatings have also been applied to minimize flare and ghosting for increased contrast when working in strong lighting conditions, and a rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality to benefit shallow depth of field imagery. Classic in terms of focal length yet optimized for the recent breed of high-resolution DSLRs, this portrait-length prime melds a familiar perspective with contemporary performance.Complementing the optical assets, this lens is also characterized by Vibration Compensation image stabilization, which minimizes the appearance of camera shake by up to 3.5 stops for sharper handheld shooting. Also aiding in creating sharp imagery, a robust ring-type USD autofocus motor with an optimized USD actuator is used for noticeably fast and accurate focusing performance. This focusing system also lends itself to full-time manual focus control for fine-tuned precision. A moisture-resistant physical construction enables its use in trying environments and the front element has also received a fluorine coating to guard against smudges and moisture from affecting image quality. Additionally, this lens is compatible with the optional TAP-in Console for fine-tuning focusing performance and updating the lens' firmware.An ideal portrait-length prime, this 85mm lens is designed for FX-format Nikon F-mount DSLRs, and is also compatible with DX models where it will provide a 127.5mm equivalent focal length.Fast f/1.8 maximum aperture benefits working in low-light conditions and also affords extensive control over focus placement for greater separation of subjects from the background, as well as the ability to produce selective imagery.Both LD (Low Dispersion) and XLD (Extra Low Dispersion) glass elements are incorporated in the 13 elements, 9 groups optical design, and contribute to a marked reduction in chromatic aberrations and color fringing throughout the aperture range.eBAND (Extended Bandwidth & Angular-Dependency) and BBAR (Broad-Band Anti-Reflection) coatings have been applied to lens elements to reduce surface reflections and prevent lens flare and ghosting for increased contrast and color accuracy.VC (Vibration Compensation) image stabilization is incorporated into the lens' design to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to 3.5 stops for sharper handheld shooting in low-light conditions.Ring-type USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) motor and an optimized USD actuator are employed for fast, precise, and quiet autofocus performance that benefits both stills and video recording. This motor also enables full-time manual focus control without having to shift into a dedicated MF mode.Moisture-resistant construction incorporates seals around the lens mount and other areas to benefit working in inclement conditions. Additionally, a fluorine coating has been applied to the front lens element to repel water, fingerprints, and smudges for easier cleaning of the lens surface.Rounded nine-blade diaphragm produces a pleasing out-of-focus quality when working with shallow depth of field techniques.An electromagnetic diaphragm system is used to ensure more consistent exposure results, especially at higher continuous shooting rates.Compatible with the optional TAP-in Console for updating the lens' firmware as well as adjusting focus settings via the TAP-in Utility software.SILKYPIX Developer Studio software for Tamron is included with the lens, which, aside from enabling basic raw processing and image adjustments, works to specifically correct for various aberrations, including color fringing, distortion, and peripheral light fall-off, using dedicated optical data from Tamron's SP-series of lenses.",600,0,Nikon Tamron 85mm 1.8 SP

Zero blemishes. I have included numerous pictures from different angles to show this. This was a backup to my 5D Mark II (also for sale separately), but I seldom picked this up (got used to full frame). It has advantages over the 5D Mark II - higher resolution, WiFi, GPS, articulating, touchscreen LCD, and is lighter (all even better if you're into videos as well). It was mostly paired with my Canon 17-55mm f/2.8 IS (also for sale separately), and it was incredible to use both together. In my opinion, image quality was comparable to the 5D Mark II in a lot of real world scenarios, which is saying a lot.Kit lenses were hardly used.Full specifications: https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/dslr/eos-70dSale comes with:-          Canon 70D body with body cap and strap-          Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS with front and rear lens caps-          Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 III with front and rear lens caps (front is generic pinch cap)-          Charger-          BatteryThis is the perfect set up to start with.

1,"Excellent Cosmetic and mechanical condition. The shutter count is 44,000. You won't find a D700 in such excellent condition, given its age. You can read more about D700, but those who are still interested in D700 in 2017 know its worth and that Nikon has not produced any other camera that can create so true to life skin colors. Nikonians go an extra mile to create the color profile of D700 for the D750 and D8XX bodies.Price firm.
