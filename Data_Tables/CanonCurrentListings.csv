SIGMA 20mm f/1.4 ART for CANON Wide Angle Camera Lens,"I bought this lens brand new from BH on March 4 2018 thinking it would be used frequently. I used it on one trip to the PNW and haven't used it since then. It's practically brand new. No optical or physical issues. Retail this lens is $900, so $300 off for barely 3 months of ownership is a great deal. Cash only, I do not ship, meet in person in the DMV area. Text or email only. Do not call me please.
