"Product DetailsProduct InformationThe Canon EF 100mm Camera Lens is the perfect lightweight lens to take with you on day trips. It provides dual auto and manual focus, which means it's great for both the beginner hobbyist and the seasoned professional. The auto clutch mechanism helps to avoid blurring while the camera autofocuses, which means you get crisp, clear shots every time. The manual focus option offers a wide, easy to control ring, which makes it easy to focus on the elements you want in your photo. The lens is made with two low-dispersion AD glass elements, which help to provide excellent contrast while also helping to correct chromatic abberations and other image distortions.
